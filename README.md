# Elements to Links
=====================

JavaScript library that scans the page for header tags and converts them to links on the fly, so that people can link to relevant content on your long page more easily. Works a bit like GitHub's markdown headers being automatically linked.

Need to share something more specific than just a section of a page? Check out one of my other projects: [http://reff.it](reff.it).

## Installation

Just include the script in your page, i.e.

`<script src="/js/lib/elements-to-links.js"></script>`

## Contribute

I will happily accept pull requests/bug fixes! Some ideas:

* disclude selectors from being made linkable, e.g. {doNotLink: ['h3.subtitle']}
* add tests

## Version 0.1.0
